# Story: File Navigation Enhancements

## Description

Group files by directory with collapse/expand and sorting options (Enhancements for the Tree View)

## Initial Notes

Consider performance with deep directory structures. Use VS Code's tree view patterns. Implement sorting options (name, path, last modified) with caching. Add collapse/expand functionality. Current status: ✅ Basic sorting by name, ✅ File count badges. Next: Implement parent directory grouping, Add more sorting options with persistence.
