# Story: Core Display

## Description

Show matching files in a dedicated panel/sidebar with full file paths and direct file opening

## Initial Notes

Foundation for other features. Need to decide between panel vs sidebar approach. Consider truncation for long paths. Enable direct file opening from matches list. Current implementation: ✅ Basic file icons and paths, ✅ Error handling, ✅ Auto-refresh. Next: Add file size and last modified date to tooltips.
