# Story: Workspace Index Optimization

## Description

Implement efficient workspace indexing using VSCode's internal APIs and file system watchers

## Initial Notes

Use VSCode's workspace.findFiles() with optimized patterns. Implement file system watcher-based index updates. Consider caching strategies for large workspaces. Add background indexing with progress indicators. Support incremental updates for better performance. Consider using vscode.workspace.textDocuments for opened files. Add configuration for index update frequency and caching behavior.
