## BLOCKED TASKS

> **Purpose:** This file lists tasks that cannot proceed due to external dependencies, unanswered questions, or other impediments. They may originate from `REFINE.md`, `READY.md`, or even `NOW.md`.
> **Action:** Regularly review items here. When a blocker is resolved, move the task back to the appropriate section in its original file (e.g., `REFINE.md` for further refinement if needed, or `READY.md` if it's now actionable). Add a comment or update the task description indicating why it was blocked and how it was unblocked.
